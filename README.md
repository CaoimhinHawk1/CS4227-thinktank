# User Profile Settings Module # by Fawad Shahzad 18265693

## About This Project ##
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is the User Profile & Settings Module for the Research Management System (RMS). This part of the project lets users log in, manage their profile, and customize their settingsâ€”like making their profile public or private and enabling/disabling notifications.

Itâ€™s built with React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, following a microservices approach to keep things modular and scalable

 ## What Can You Do Here? ##
âœ… Log in with demo credentials (hardcoded for now).
âœ… View your profile (name, email, role).
âœ… Edit your profile (update name and email).
âœ… Change visibility (public/private toggle).
âœ… Turn notifications on/off (manage alerts).
âœ… Log out when you're done.

## Tech Behind the Scenes ##
ðŸ”¹ Frontend: React (with components for login, profile, settings).
ðŸ”¹ Backend: Spring Boot (handles user data and authentication).
ðŸ”¹ API Calls: RESTful APIs connect the frontend and backend.
ðŸ”¹ Storage: No real database yetâ€”just mock data for now.

## How to Run It Locally ##
1- Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/CaoimhinHawk1/CS4227-thinktank.git

cd user-profile-settings

2- Start the Backend

Make sure you have Java & Maven installed, then run:

mvn spring-boot:run

This starts the backend, so it can handle login and profile updates.

3- Start the Frontend

Open another terminal, go to the React frontend folder, and run: 

*cd frontend*

*npm install*

*npm start*

Now open http://localhost:3000 in your browserâ€”you should see the login page! ðŸŽ‰
